1. kubectl version

2. kubectl apply -f filename.yml //  (go to the infra/k8s directory, and chose the config filename)

# List all pods in ps output format
3. kubectl get pods


If your pods are showing ErrImagePull, ErrImageNeverPull, or 
ImagePullBackOff errors after running kubectl apply, 
the simplest solution is to provide an imagePullPolicy to the pod.

4. First, run kubectl delete -f infra/k8s/

Then, update your pod manifest:

spec:
  containers:
    - name: posts
      image: irfanuddin/posts:0.0.1
      imagePullPolicy: Never
Then, run kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/

This will ensure that Kubernetes will use the image built locally from your image cache instead of attempting to pull from a registry.

7. kubectl exec -it posts sh // [posts -> pod_name] [sh -> cmd]

8. kubectl logs posts // [posts -> pod name]

9. kubectl describe pod  posts // [posts -> pod name]
